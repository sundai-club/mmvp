# [2025-03-15] Project Goals and Objectives Definition

## Context
As we begin our AI-first organization project, we need to establish clear goals and objectives to guide our development efforts and ensure alignment across all aspects of the project.

## Decision
We have defined our project's vision, mission, strategic goals, and specific objectives as documented in [Goals and Objectives](../../business/goals-and-objectives.md). The key strategic goals are:

1. AI Integration
2. Process Optimization
3. Knowledge Management
4. Community Building

Each goal has specific, measurable objectives with target dates for completion.

## Consequences
- All development efforts will be aligned with these goals and objectives
- We can measure progress against specific objectives
- The team has a clear understanding of what we're trying to achieve
- Future decisions can be evaluated against these goals

## Alternatives Considered
- More narrow focus on just AI tooling without the organizational aspects
- Broader focus on digital transformation in general
- Project-by-project approach without an overarching strategy

These alternatives were rejected in favor of a comprehensive AI-first organizational approach that balances technical implementation with organizational change management.
