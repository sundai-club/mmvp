# Project Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the high-level architecture of our AI-first organization platform. The architecture is designed to support our goals of AI integration, process optimization, knowledge management, and community building.

## Components

### Core Platform
- **AI Secretary**: Central AI assistant for daily operations and coordination
- **Knowledge Base**: Structured documentation and organizational memory
- **Decision Engine**: AI-assisted decision-making framework
- **Process Automation**: Workflow automation tools

### User Interfaces
- **Command Line Interface**: For technical users and automation
- **Web Dashboard**: For visual management and reporting
- **Chat Interface**: For conversational interaction with AI systems

### Integration Layer
- **API Gateway**: For connecting with external services
- **Data Connectors**: For importing/exporting data from various sources
- **Webhook System**: For event-driven architecture

## Data Flow

1. **Input Collection**: User requests and system events are collected through various interfaces
2. **Context Building**: Relevant context is gathered from the knowledge base and external systems
3. **Processing**: AI models process the input with the context to generate responses or actions
4. **Action Execution**: System executes actions based on processing results
5. **Feedback Collection**: Results and user feedback are collected
6. **Knowledge Update**: System updates its knowledge base based on outcomes and feedback

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- Modern web framework (React/Vue.js)
- Terminal-based interfaces
- Chat interfaces

### Backend
- API-first design
- Event-driven architecture
- Serverless functions for scalability

### AI/ML
- Large Language Models for natural language understanding and generation
- Specialized models for specific tasks
- Vector databases for semantic search
- Use Maestro from ai21 as the agentic framework. See docs here https://docs.ai21.com

### Data Storage
- Document databases for unstructured content
- Relational databases for structured data
- Vector stores for embeddings

## Security Considerations

- **Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication for all users
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control
- **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit
- **Privacy**: Clear data usage policies and user consent management
- **AI Safety**: Monitoring and guardrails for AI systems

## Deployment Architecture

- **Development Environment**: For testing new features
- **Staging Environment**: For pre-production validation
- **Production Environment**: For end-user access
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: For automated testing and deployment
- **Monitoring**: For system health and performance tracking
